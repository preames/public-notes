These are a collection of local experiments with slightly hacked up
aspects of vectorization lowering to perform limit study experiments.

improved-active-lane-mask.log -- uses an improved active lane mask lowering
which includes both a sound and unsound component (ult vid, usubsat(TC, I))
in i32 unconditionally.

evl-via-umin.log -- pin the second to last iteration to VF via a umin
instruction.  This contains basic functionality, but not the feature
unlock parts.

evl-via-umin-no-restrictions.log -- built on the previous, but remove
all restrictions for EVL vectorization which don't apply to maks
tail folding

mask-early-expand.log -- expand the header mask to vid <u splat(sub(TC-Index))
early in loop vect instead of using active.lane.mask
