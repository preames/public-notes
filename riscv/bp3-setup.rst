Banana PI 3 Setup Notes
-----------------------

This board was released in Q2 2024, and appears to be the first relatively widely available board with vector 1.0.  The ISA is rva22u w/V and VLEN=256.  This page is my notes from trying to set one up as a development board.

Download the OS Image
---------------------

Directly from the vendor `here <https://docs.banana-pi.org/en/BPI-F3/BananaPi_BPI-F3#_system_image>`_.  Make sure you grab the SD card images.  The easiest downloads are the google drive ones unless you speak Chinese.  


Format/Partition the SD Card
----------------------------

First, figure out which device corresponds to the your SD card.  The rest of this assumes it is `/dev/sda` -- make sure you change for your environment!

.. code::

   lsblk

Zero the entire SD card.  Do not skip this step, or you get weird hangs at boot time.

.. code::

   sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=4096 status=progress

Format the partion table, etc...  (`For a lot more detail on this step <https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-format-usb-sd-card-linux/>`_.)

.. code::
   
   sudo parted /dev/sda --script -- mklabel msdos
   sudo parted /dev/sda --script -- mkpart primary fat32 1MiB 100%
   sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1
   sudo parted /dev/sda --script print

Copy the contents of your img to the device.

.. code::
  
   sudo dd if=/home/preames/DevBoards/BananaPI/bianbu-23.10-desktop-k1-v1.0rc3-release-20240525133016.img of=/dev/sda status=progress bs=4M

Use `gparted`, or tool of your choice, to resize the final fat32 partition to fill available space.  If you skip this step, installing new packages will fail due to insufficient space.

Boot It
-------

I plugged in a HDMI monitory, keyboard, and mouse.  Then went through the initial setup to e.g. configure WiFi.  After that, I switched to SSH login.

If this step fails (i.e. hangs), go back and read the warnings on the zeroing and formatting section again.

Initial Setup
-------------

Do the usual update:

.. code::

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade

Install the usual packages:

.. code::

   sudo apt-get --assume-yes install emacs man-db libc6-dev dpkg-dev make build-essential binutils binutils-dev gcc g++ autoconf python3 git clang cmake patchutils ninja-build flex bison

Getting `perf` working
----------------------

Do the following:

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/pi-linux
   cd pi-linux
   uname --all
   # Checkout the right branch for your kernel version
   git checkout linux-6.1.15-k1
   pushd tools/perf/pmu-events
   ./jevents.py riscv arch pmu-events.c
   popd
   sudo apt install libelf-dev libdw-dev flex bison
   sudo make -C tools/ NO_LIBBPF=1 WERROR=0 prefix=/usr/local/ perf_install

These instructions are inspired by `this blog post <https://dev.to/luzero/bringing-up-bpi-f3-part-25-27o4>`_.  Note that I'm running on the  `bianbu-23.10-desktop-k1-v1.0rc3-release-20240525133016` image, and that the default counter names appear to work for me in `perf stat`.  The synthetic `instructions` and `cycles` events do not work with `perf record`.  Reasonable proxies are `inst_issues` and `m_mode_cycles`.  

LLVM Native Build
-----------------

You *can* do an LLVM native build on these, but it takes quite a while.  The filesystem on the SD card is insanely slow, so just getting a git checkout in place took a while; starting from a zip file probably would have been a better idea.  It might also have been a good idea to setup the MMC storage first.  Due to memory limitations, you end up needing to build without parallelism (e.g. "ninja -j1").  Doing so takes a bit over 38 hours.  I was able to build both the llvm 17 and llvm 18 release branches.

I strongly recommend configuring to build only RISCV and the projects you actually need.  Doing so greatly reduces the number of files build, and is the only thing which makes this vaguely practical.  I build RISCV only, and only LLVM core + clang.
